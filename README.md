*Now all your transit services are just one big button away!*

**PingMe** is a light-weight Android application that allows users to call transit agents like taxis, rickshaws, etc by pressing just a single button. In short, this application can be called a *location relaying service* based on the principles of Instant Messaging. 

## Primary objective ##

----------

These objectives are what define the application, and will not be compromised on. All these objectives will get full priority during the development phase of this project.

The main objectives of this app are:

* Allow users to notify agents of their location
* Allow agents to handle requests with ease
* Route calculation
* Provide emergency facilities for unforeseen difficulties
* Image relaying to send photographs of nearby location

## Secondary objective ##

----------

Secondary objectives, though not very important, would still be good to have. Therefore, if time permits, following features will be incorporated into the system.

The secondary objectives of this app are:

* Providing bus time tables using APIs
* Parental lock to avoid accidental summons
* User feedback to rate transit agents.
* Allow clients to set time-based or location-based reminders
* Agent-specific location relaying
* and many more to come...

## Privacy and security ##

----------

Unlike other location-based services like Foursquare and Latitude, this service *does not* reveal the true identity of the user. This means that the transit agent has no clue of who is summoning him. As such, there is no danger of stalking or harassment as a side-effct of using this app.

Apart from this, the messages sent to server from your phones are encrypted using RSA and further serialized so that no intruderr can capture these packets and decode the information.
